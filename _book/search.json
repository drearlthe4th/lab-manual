More about our group’s research activity can be found on our website.\nThis lab manual is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we work and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Dr. Smith or, if you’re already github-savvy, make a pull request 👉.\nThe spark for this book comes from a similar lab manual I found for The Fay Lab, which itself stemmed from the Openscapes Champions program.\n\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "2.1 Meetings\nThe lab has two types of meetings: lab meetings and 1-on-1s with Dr. Smith\n\n2.1.1 Lab meetings\n\nWhen we meet: For 1 hour, every other week. The specific day/time will often change from semester to semester, depending on lab members schedules, but we aim to find a time that works for everyone.\nHow we meet: Lab meetings are in person supplemented with Zoom for those unable to make it to campus. Students, in particular, should try to attend these meetings in person as much as possible.\nWhat we discuss: Determined by the lab members (and occasionally trumped by Dr. Smith to discuss pressing issues), but generally, these are research-related discussions. Most often, ongoing work in the lab, including, e.g., presenting draft study designs or preliminary analyses for feedback, discussing specific problems with an ongoing project and how we can overcome these. Sometimes topics may not be specific to a particular research project, but instead related concepts. For example, how to respond to reviewer comments, an overview of a new dataset being introduced to the lab, or a tutorial on creating a nice visualization.\nWho decides what we discuss: The lab members. One team member designated by Dr. Smith (typically senior GS or post-doc) coordinates the discussion topics for each lab meeting, and students should send discussion topics to them, or add to the agenda directly that is maintained on the General channel in CVmedLab Teams.\nWhat you should expect: You should expect to present fairly regularly, both to keep the lab updated on what you’re doing, but also because nothing in our world goes perfectly smoothly. If you’re not having problems you need to work through, the rest of us probably have concerns. You should also expect to contribute to discussions - we all have a unique background and set of experiences that can contribute meaningful insight to the discussion. Sometimes the ideas we think are the littlest (or possibly even worst) are in fact the most helpful.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 1-on-1 meetings\n\nWhen we meet: For 1 hour, every other week (on the off-week from the whole lab meeting). The specific day/time will often change from semester to semester, depending on your schedule.\nHow we meet: Dr. Smith prefers in person, but Zoom is also acceptable, if needed.\nWhat we discuss: Determined completely by you. This is your opportunity to discuss what is most pressing in your opinion: ongoing research, your IDP, school/class issues, any highlights or difficulties in the past couple of weeks, or just shoot the breeze. If there’s something more complicated that you want Dr. Smith to know about/review in advance, make sure he gets this before the meeting (see below for how to get this to him)."

Most of the feedback we give and receive is during lab meetings, on research products (e.g., abstracts, posters, papers), and when giving or attending seminars. We expect feedback to be supportive but constructive.\nThis resource from UBC does a really great job of outlining the main points of how to give and receive feedback."

    "section": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Dr. Smith)",
    "text": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Dr. Smith)\nIt is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don’t have to be followed absolutely, but should guide most of what we’re sharing and make things easier on the team. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you.\nTaking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in Wilson et. al paper linked above).\nProject management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses, particularly if you’re working in R and/or with analytic datasets that can be posted publicly. Use ‘Issues’ on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work for us in many cases due to data privacy/DUA issues with publicly posting patient-level data. Alternatively, make use of a Teams/Sharepoint (or, less preferably, Dropbox) for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook.\n\n2.3.1 Code\nCode can be shared in the virtual machines, or alternatively through Teams, Dropbox, or Github repositories. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a reprex (minimal reproducible example). Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.\n\n\n2.3.2 Documents/Writing\nManuscripts and similar text documents can be created/shared in Quarto/R Markdown, if you’re particularly motivated, or alternatively, in Dropbox or Teams. Quarto/R Markdown offer the advantage of being easily/quickly reproducible any time the underlying data change (e.g., w/o having to retype all the particular data points, re-do Tables, etc..). Dropbox allows for collaborative writing, and has the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Teams/Sharepoint is also acceptable. Email is the least preferred approach for within-team collaboration, and should really be reserved (if needed) for getting comments from collaborators outside of our team. Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (please no “mythesis.doc”).\nWe maintain a lab Teams sharepoint folder (accessible via Teams) for lab work, presentations, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work. Final publications will also be linked on our website and advertised on Twitter by the @UFCoDES and @CVmedLab accounts."

You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab’s shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc)."

It’s even rare that a single person has the necessary experience/knowledge to sufficiently cover one of those arms. We collaborate, both within the CVmedLab, as well as outside it, because we most often work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization."

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the School’s and university’s academic policies.\nSome Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.\nHarassment includes:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\n\nThe Fay lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Gavin Fay) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”\nCommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial\nCriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n\n4.2.1 Reporting\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Gavin Fay, at gfay@umassd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n4.2.2 Consequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces.\n\n\n4.2.3 Additional resources\nOther University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents:\n\nPolicy Against Intolerance\nPrinciples of Employee Conduct\nResolution in Support of Pluralism\nNon-Discrimination and Harassment Policy\nStatement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity\nStatement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion\nStatement on Gender Discrimination\nBully, Harassment and Violence\nStudent Conduct Policies and Procedures\nSexual Harassment Policy\nTitle IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment"

    "text": "13.1 Electronic Health Record (EHR) data\n\n13.1.1 OneFlorida+\nOneFlorida+ is one of 11 clinical research networks (CRNs) that comprise the Patient-Centered Ourcomes Research network (PCORnet). Quite a bit of our work is done on OneFlorida+ data, or data from OneFlorida+ and other PCORnet CRNs. The good news is they all adhere to the PCORnet common data model (scroll to the bottom of the page), which you will need to familiarize yourself with if you’re working on OneFl+/PCORnet data. In particular, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the relevant tables and variables. If you’re unsure whether you’ll be working with OneFl+/PCORnet data, ask Dr. Smith.\nOneFlorida+ includes EHR data from health system partners across Florida (UF, University of Miami, University of South Florida, Orlando Health, Florida Hospital [Orlando], Tallahassee Memorial, and others), as well as University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) and Emory University. In addition, it contains Florida Medicaid claims data. Data are generally available from ~2012 onward. As you’ll see on reviewing the common data model, the available data are generally structured data (rather than unstructured clinical texts like provider notes, imaging reports, etc..).\n\n\n13.1.2 UFHealth data\nThe UF integrated data repository is a database of UFHealth EHR data, including both structured and unstructured data. The IDR has an i2b2 implementation which can be used for simple queries, i.e., to find counts of patients that meet certain criteria. The IDR i2b2 implementation can be found here (you’ll need to register for an account here and you’ll need to be on campus or on the HSC VPN to access i2b2).\nWe are currently in the process of linking UFHealth data with our Medicare claims data for patients in both data sources."

    "text": "13.2 Claims data\nMajor claims data sources housed in POP/CoDES include CMS data and IBM Marketscan. Brief descriptions are below. Additional information can be found here.\n\n13.2.1 CMS data (Medicare, Medicaid)\n\nMedicaid\nMedicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) and T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF) data contain claims for medical care and drug benefits received by beneficiaries with Medicaid insurance coverage, the state-run programs for low-income and categorically eligible individuals and families. CoDES has in-house MAX data for over >120 million beneficiaries residing in the 29 most populous states from 1999-2010 (AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MN, MO, MS, NC, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, WI, WV) and national data (all 50 states plus the district of Columbia) from 2011-2016.\nMedicaid data has been linked to birth certificates from the Florida Department of Health (1999-2014), Texas Department of State Health Services (1999-2012) and New Jersey Department of Health (1999-2010). The entire national Medicaid data set includes validated mother-infant linkages.\n\n\nMedicare\nMedicare data include claims for inpatient, skilled care nursing facility, and hospice care (Part A) as well as outpatient care (Part B) and prescription drugs (Part D). CoDES center has a somewhat complicated sample of Medicare, due in part to our desire to link UFHealth EHR data with Medicare data.\nBasically, the current sample includes the following:\n\nA 5% national Medicare sample (random sample of 5% of Medicare patients nationwide who meet the above criteria for parts A, B, and D) for the years 2011 through 2015 plus 1 million beneficiaries in FL sampled from individuals who reside in the UF Health catchment area (to ensure we could link most UFHealth patients)\nA 15% national Medicare beneficiaries plus the entire state of Florida for 2016-2018, totaling >8 million lives.\n\nWe are anticipating continuing to grow the data (additional years).\nResDAC contains excellent documentation of the Medicare files, variables, and availability from year-to-year. If you’re going to use Medicare data, you’ll need to get to know these data dictionaries.\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Marketscan\nThe IBM Marketscan Commericial claims database includes 2005-2020 health insurance claims for inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy encounters, as well as enrollment data from large employers and health plans across the United States who provide healthcare coverage for their employees, their spouses, and dependents. The current dataset includes >192 million lives.\nThe Medicare Supplemental data includes 2005-2020 enrollment records along with inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims for >12.9 million retirees in the United States with Medicare supplemental coverage through privately-insured fee-for-service, point-of-service, or capitated health plans.\nThe Health Risk Assessment (HRA) data includes 2012-2018 self-reported biometric and health-related behavioral data obtained through surveys of employees of large US corporations and health plans. HRA is linked to medical, pharmacy, and enrollment data for these employees in the Commercial claims data (above) and used to examine the relationships between health behaviors/risk and health outcomes or medical expenditures. Linked data is available for about 5% of beneficiaries."

Includes adjudicated cardivoascular events, as well as all-cause death data through at least 2015.\nWISE cohort - we have access to the Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) cohort, which was a multisite prospective cohort study of women with suspected myocardial ischemia.\nWomen Take Heart - we have access to the Women Take Heart cohort, which was a Chicago-based prospective cohort study of ~8k women without cardiovascular disease, enrolled in 1992 and with death follow-up through at least 2008.\nWARRIOR trial - The Women’s IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events In Non-ObstRuctive CAD is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE design) of a pragmatic strategy of intensive medical therapy (incl. ACEI or ARB + statin) vs usual care in 4,422 symptomatic women with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Publicly-Available datasets\nThe CDC curates a number of valuable datasets that are relatively easy to access and generally offer cleaned, curated datasets that are analysis-ready. Some common ones we use/see in our field include:\n\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) - a complex survey design that is completed every 2 years and allows for inference about what is happening across the non-instutitionalized U.S. population\nNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) - Data provided by providers (not patients) about patient visits in a single week of the year; allows for inference about what is happening at outpatient visits in the U.S.\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) - state-administered surveys, completed annually, and curated by the CDC\nAnd, lots of others from the National Center for Health Statistics\nMedical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) - a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers across the United States; MEPS is the most complete source of data on the cost and use of health care and health insurance coverage in the U.S.\nFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) - datasets containing Adverse Events reported to the FDA on drugs; there is a similar reporting system administered by DHHS for vaccines, called VAERS"

    "text": "14.1 SAS\nAs noted above, SAS is the primary platform used in our program. We use SAS fairly extensively in our lab’s work as well, in part because it’s particularly good at working with massive datasets. SAS is available on all of our Virtual Machines/servers, and UF offers discounted annual licenses for SAS (as well as a free cloud-based SAS through UFApps) for enrolled students. More info on individual licenses can be found here for students and here for faculty/postdocs/staff. Note that staff/postdocs should get their license through the Department by contacting Carl Henriksen.\nSome folks like working in base SAS by itself. Others prefer SAS Enterprise Guide, which wraps around base R and provides some additional functionality. Try each, and see what you prefer.\nOne downside to SAS is it does not run natively on MacOS, so if you have a Mac, you’ll need Parallels, VMware, or similar hardware virtualization to create a windows drive, if you want SAS on your own system.\n\n14.1.1 Books\nThere are lots of good SAS books out there, but here’s a couple you might find particularly useful. (* denotes texts Dr. Smith has electronic copies of and that can be ‘checked out’ within the lab.)\n\nThe little SAS book, 6th ed. (you can access this one from campus or on the VPN - Dr. Smith also has a copy of 5th ed.*) (Delwiche and Slaughter 2019)\nAnalysis of Observational Health Care Data using SAS* (Faries and Institute 2010)\nSurvival analysis with SAS: A practical guide* (Allison 2010)\n\n\n\n14.1.2 Useful online articles/links/blogs\n\nSAS Procedures by Name - This is a must-have bookmark to the official SAS documentation; you will use it often and it’s quite helpful.\nUCLA Office of Advanced Research Computing tutorials - a good starting place for basics of running relatively simple analyses/data wrangling and interpreting.\nUF PHC 6052 course tutorials - you’ll take this class relatively early in the program, but still a useful resource\nThe DO loop - excellent and very productive blog by Rick Wicklin\nLexJansen.com - not a particularly user-friendly site, but contains tons of SAS-related papers. Your best bet is just googling your problem, but there’s a good chance the top hits will be papers in PDF form on this site.\n\n\n\n14.1.3 Macros\n\nSqueeze - shrink datasets by minimizing variable lengths to minimum necessary for the actual dataset\n[Magic Macro] - to add\nBasic Dataset Characterization\nOptionReset - reset default options, if you’ve somehow mangled yours\nms_freezedata - a mini-SENTINEL program macro that creates subsets of patient-level data from a supplied patient id list\n[Table 1] - to add"

    "section": "14.2 R",
    "text": "14.2 R\n\n14.2.1 Base R\nYou can download base R for free from C-RAN here. Make sure you select the correct file for your computer system (and chip, if using a Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need base R\n\n\n\nYou need to install base R, even if you will use R-Studio (recommended). Otherwise, R-Studio won’t do you much good.\n\n\nInstallation should be straight-forward and easy, and you can use defaults. If needed, there are comprehensive instructions (HTML and PDF) available on C-RAN.\nThe R development team has some good, if somewhat dense, manuals available at C-RAN here. A good place to start is the Intro to R (HTML and PDF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBase R is updated pretty frequently, but you won’t be bugged about it. It’s a good idea to check periodically to see if you are behind a few releases. The easiest way to update is to just re-install the new version, using the same process you did the first time around (download the compiled software and re-install; it will write over the old version).\nUnlike python, the R development team takes great pains to not break things with any new releases, so it’s rare that an update will cause you any problems with old code.\n\n\n\n\n14.2.2 R-Studio and extensions\nWe recommend you use R-studio on top of R. Select the free desktop version here (note: skip to step 2 since you will have hopefully already installed base R). Again, make sure you download the correct file for your operating system and note that the website often assumes you run Windows - if you don’t, scroll down a bit further to make sure you get the right file for your OS.\nAgain, installation should be straight-forward and easy, and you can use defaults.\nThere are some useful extensions for R-studio, but none are absolutely necessary:\n\nQuarto - useful for generating all sorts of R-markdown, including papers (yes, you could actually write your manuscript in Quarto), technical reports, websites, books (this lab manual was written with Quarto!); the beauty of R-markdown is you can weave together plain text and R code seamlessly into an output document (.html, .docx, .pdf, etc) - that means you can have all of your analysis code re-generate everything automatically any time you make a slight change to the cohort or underlying data.\n\nOne ‘to-do’ for the lab might be to make a manuscript template which would make writing routine parts of manuscripts considerably easier 🤔\n\n\n\n\n14.2.3 R packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Packages\n\n\n\nR packages are installed by typing install.packages(\"package_name\") in the interactive window (or in a new script, which is then run). For example, install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You’ll sometimes see ‘dependencies’ installed as well - these are other packages that are required to run the package you’re installing. If you get questions about compiling from source, just select No unless you really need that slightly newer version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction vs. Development packages\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below listed packages are all hosted on C-RAN and can be installed with the install.packages() function. You may come across packages in development that you want to install, or development versions of established packages that have not been pushed to C-RAN yet. These can usually be installed from, e.g., github, using the devtools package, with something like devtools::install_github(\"github_user/package_name\") and typically the package will supply a similar instruction if you find the associated webpage or github page.\n\n\n\n\n14.2.3.1 Data wrangling\nThe following packages are particularly useful for dealing with raw data as well as basic analyses:\n\ntidyverse - a suite of packages that make R considerably easier to learn for the new user (in our opinion); bonus points because they’re supported by Posit (makers of R-Studio) and are constantly being improved, unlike some packages which eventually languish. We suggest installing the entire tidyverse with install.packages(\"tidyverse\") but you can also install components of the tidyverse individually\ndata.table\nlabelled\n[]\n\n\n\n14.2.3.2 Graphics & Tables\n\nggplot2 - comes with tidyverse, so does not need separate installation, but will be your go-to for plotting much of what you’ll want.\n\nggplot2 also has lots of very useful extension, which can be found here. Some we particularly like include patchwork, ggrepel, ggthemes, ggsci, ggdist, ggsignif, and survminer (there are >100!)\n\nplotly - interactive graphics\ngt\ngtExtras - extension for {gt}\ngtsummary - extension for {gt} for creating summary tables. See Lab Docs on the CVmedLab website for an example using gtsummary.\n\n\n\n14.2.3.3 Interactive data presentation\n\nshiny - builds interactive web apps from R\n\n\n\n14.2.3.4 Package development\nPackages come in all shapes and sizes and don’t have to be a set of fancy functions to be used by the R community. A common use of R packages is collating everything needed for an analysis/paper (data, notes, analytic code, +/- the paper itself). If you’re going to create packages, the following are extremely helpful:\n\ndevtools - simplifies common tasks in package development (also helpful in downloading non-C-RAN packages/versions, e.g., from github)\nusethis - automates repetitive tasks in package development\n\n\n\n14.2.3.5 Analysis\nTons of packages in this space, but if you want to stick with the tidyverse, tidymodels is a good choice.\nFor regression modeling, Frank Harrell’s rms package is good and well supported with a website.\n\n\n14.2.3.6 Other Odds-and-Ends\n\ndaggity - for creating DAGs and much more\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.4 Useful R resources"
