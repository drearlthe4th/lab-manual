    "text": "2.2 Meetings\nThe lab has three types of meetings: project meetings, lab meetings and 1-on-1s with Dr. Smith\n\n2.2.1 Project meetings\n\nWhen we meet: Depends on the project, but a typical schedule is half an hour every week or 1 hour every other week. The specific day/time may change from semester to semester, depending on schedules of those involved.\nHow we meet: In person primarily, but supplemented with Zoom for those unable to make it to campus for a particular meeting.\nWhat we discuss: Project goals, progress, barriers, etc.. These are exclusively research-related discussions, focused on the specific project. Content changes over time, as the project matures.\nWho decides what we discuss: The project lead, in conjunction with Dr. Smith and/or other collaborators. Typically our projects fund at least one student, and that team member designated by Dr. Smith serves as the project lead and coordinates the discussion topics for each meeting. Others engaged in the project should send discussion topics to them, or add to the agenda directly that is maintained on the project-specific channel in CVmedLab Teams.\nWhat you should expect: If you’re engaged in the project, you should expect to present/discuss regularly. You should also expect to contribute to discussions - we all have a unique background and set of experiences that can contribute meaningful insight to the discussion of the project.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Lab meetings\n\nWhen we meet: For 1 hour, every other week. The specific day/time will often change from semester to semester, depending on lab members schedules, but we aim to find a time that works for everyone.\nHow we meet: Lab meetings are in person supplemented with Zoom for those unable to make it to campus. Students, in particular, should try to attend these meetings in person as much as possible.\nWhat we discuss: Determined by the lab members (and occasionally trumped by Dr. Smith to discuss pressing issues), but generally, these are research-related discussions. Most often, ongoing work in the lab, including, e.g., presenting draft study designs or preliminary analyses for feedback, discussing specific problems with an ongoing project and how we can overcome these. Sometimes topics may not be specific to a particular research project, but instead related concepts. For example, how to respond to reviewer comments, an overview of a new dataset being introduced to the lab, or a tutorial on creating a nice visualization.\nWho decides what we discuss: The lab members. One team member designated by Dr. Smith (typically senior GS or post-doc) coordinates the discussion topics for each lab meeting, and students should send discussion topics to them, or add to the agenda directly that is maintained on the General channel in CVmedLab Teams.\nWhat you should expect: You should expect to present fairly regularly, both to keep the lab updated on what you’re doing, but also because nothing in our world goes perfectly smoothly. If you’re not having problems you need to work through, the rest of us probably have concerns. You should also expect to contribute to discussions - we all have a unique background and set of experiences that can contribute meaningful insight to the discussion. Sometimes the ideas we think are the littlest (or possibly even worst) are in fact the most helpful.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 1-on-1 meetings\n\nWhen we meet: For 1 hour, every other week (on the off-week from the whole lab meeting). The specific day/time will often change from semester to semester, depending on your schedule.\nHow we meet: Dr. Smith prefers in person, but Zoom is also acceptable, if needed.\nWhat we discuss: Determined completely by you. This is your opportunity to discuss what is most pressing in your opinion: ongoing research, your IDP, school/class issues, any highlights or difficulties in the past couple of weeks, or just shoot the breeze. If there’s something more complicated that you want Dr. Smith to know about/review in advance, make sure he gets this before the meeting (see below for how to get this to him).",

    "section": "2.4 How we share things (and send them to Dr. Smith)",
    "text": "2.4 How we share things (and send them to Dr. Smith)\nIt is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don’t have to be followed absolutely, but should guide most of what we’re sharing and make things easier on the team. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you.\nTaking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in the paper (Wilson et al. 2017) linked above).\nProject management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses, particularly if you’re working in R and/or with analytic datasets that can be posted publicly. Use ‘Issues’ on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work for us in many cases due to data privacy/DUA issues with publicly posting patient-level data. Alternatively, make use of a Dropbox (or Teams/Sharepoint) for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook. Ideally, use the CVmedLab Dropbox folder for your project, and keep current versions of your documents there, as well as final versions of submitted materials.\n\n2.4.1 Code\nCode can be shared in the virtual machines, or alternatively through Teams, Dropbox, or Github repositories. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a reprex (minimal reproducible example) in R, or similar in SAS. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared if you want help working through kinks.\n\n\n2.4.2 Documents/Writing\nManuscripts and similar text documents can be created/shared in Quarto/R Markdown, if you’re particularly motivated, or alternatively, in Dropbox or Teams. Quarto/R Markdown offer the advantage of being easily/quickly reproducible any time the underlying data change (e.g., w/o having to retype all the particular data points, re-do Tables, etc..). Dropbox allows for collaborative writing, and has the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Teams/Sharepoint is also acceptable. Email is the least preferred approach for within-team collaboration, and should really be reserved (if needed) for getting comments from collaborators outside of our team. Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (please no “mythesis.doc” - these invariably get lost in the shuffle).\nWe maintain a lab Dropbox, as well as Teams sharepoint folder (accessible via Teams) for lab work, presentations, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work. Final publications will also be linked on our website and posted on the CVmedLab News section. The departmental/CoDES twitter account will also share publications, if you let them know about new pubs.",

You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab’s shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc)."

Keep in mind that providing letters of recommendation and feedback on drafts take time and effort on the part of those writing them; do not apply for opportunities for which you do not meet the requirements.\nPresent your work at one conference per year (discuss with Dr. Smith funding to attend such meetings).\nBe familiar with and meet the deadlines and benchmarks laid out by the department and/or the COP Grad Programs office. Meeting these deadlines is your responsibility.\nManage study design, data analysis, and other concrete research challenges\nLook for answers in the literature\nLook for internet resources\nSolicit advice from your lab mates\nSeek advice from Dr. Smith, who is always happy to discuss issues but it is in everyone’s best interest if you work on the problem yourself first\nIf we’re still struggling, we’ll go outside of the lab for advice, but please discuss w/ Dr. Smith first.\nShare your expertise, experience, and materials with others working in the lab. There are far greater rewards for being generous with your time and knowledge than for keeping things to yourself in an attempt to prevent others from getting ahead.\nShare responsibility for mentoring more junior students working in the lab.

POP GS students have assigned space in the DSIT graduate student area (6th floor of DSIT). Assigned desks are coordinated by the POP graduate student representative(s). Post-docs and analysts typically have individual or shared office space in the same suite. Dr. Smith’s office is DSIT 6305.\nLab meetings are currently held in shared conference rooms (usually DSIT 6022).\n\n\n5.3.2 Building & suite access\nAccess to the DSIT building is via your GatorOne card (physical or on your phone). You may also hear of it being referred to ‘lenel’ access. Office space is restricted to POP-affiliated individuals, so that only faculty, staff, and students in POP generally have access. This means your stuff is generally safe at your cubicle. But, should you feel a need to lock particularly sensitive items up, you’ll also have access to keyed storage. As we are still fairly new in this space, it’s possible policies change from time to time. But, generally, the suite is locked 24/7, requiring lenel access to enter. The building is open during business hours (e.g., 7 am to 5 pm), but locked to the general public after that. Students (as well as staff/faculty) in our program can access the building/POP suite at any time, as long as they have their GatorOne card (physical or on your phone).\n\n\n5.3.3 Parking and transportation:\nParking on campus is less than optimal, as spaces are limited, fairly expensive, and particularly for students, not very close to DSIT. Most students bus, bike, or walk to campus. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the TAPS webpage.",

Typically, PhD students are funded by the College/Department for ~1 year (3-5 semesters, depending on the specifics of the student). Thereafter, funding is ultimately the responsibility of the faculty advisor. As a consequence, we do our best to plan ahead, taking students when we think we will have funding to cover them 2-4 years out from acceptance into the program. But, that also means sometimes we are not able to accept students when funding is tight or pending.\nFor the MS program, students are typically expected to self-fund their program.\nWhen we have grant-funded position openings in the lab, we will post these through the lab website, twitter account, and via other distribution feeds. Current members will be encouraged to reach out to their network to advertise the position also so that we can get the best candidates possible."

    "text": "10.1.1 Registration\nAcademic credit registration management in our program is done through the COP Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Registration for each semester takes place about mid-way (sometimes slightly later) through the previous semester and you will receive communication from the Graduate Coordinator for the department on deadlines. It is critical to register promptly to facilitate faculty and institutional planning (and avoid late registration fees). Before registering for each semester, you should meet with Dr. Smith to review your milestone document and discuss registration plans for the forthcoming semester (courses and/or research credits, etc). See Chapter 11 for details on courses available to POP graduate students.\nCourse of study should be selected with the program requirements in mind - but remember that electives are built in, and these should be tailored towards the skills you hope to leave the PhD program with.\nMost students take their core program requirements in the first 1-2 years. Depending on course availability, it is possible coursework may extend into year 3. Keep in mind that required courses, including college-wide courses, are required unless you receive explicit approval to skip these.\nStarting primarily in year 3 (sometimes year 2), most students will take 3-6 hours (possibly more) of research credits. Prior to beginning work on your dissertation, these courses will be independent research courses requiring independent research projects. Such projects are developed by the student in coordination with Dr. Smith. Deliverables must be declared when signing up for the credits, and it’s important that students consider what is feasible in a semester and propose deliverables accordingly. Later in year 3, and especially in year 4, the shift will be towards advanced research credits while students devote time to thesis work.\nThesis credits: Thesis credits are required for both MS and PhD degrees. It is your responsibility to understand credit requirements, particularly for thesis credits. Once thesis and dissertation credit requirements have been met, MS and PhD students will often maintain registration through ‘continuation of program’ credit, where no credits are earned but enrollment status is maintained.\n\n\n10.1.2 Dissertation\nYou should aim to complete your dissertation within ~4 years of starting the program. Coursework will largely be completed by end of year ~2, giving you ~2 years to complete dissertation work. Keep in mind that the Department typically only guarantees funding for 4 years. A major barrier to completing the PhD in 4 years is a lag time between completing coursework and settling on dissertation aims and completing the written qualifying exam. So, be thinking about your dissertation no later than year 2, so you have a plan entering year 3.\n\n10.1.2.1 Timeline\n\nYear 1\nYour dissertation work begins in Year 1, when you begin to form your committee. In fact, you need to have your internal committee in place by the end of year 1 of the program. So, you should be meeting with other faculty in the graduate program to identify potential members of your committee (don’t worry, we can change these later as the dissertation takes form).\nAlso in Year 1, you will need to declare a specialization. If you’re in our lab, this is likely pharmacoepidemiology, or possibly health services research.\n\n\nYear 2\nBy end of year 2, you need to have your full committee (≥3 internal members + ≥1 external) in place, including the external member. The external member should be identified by you, but certainly discuss options with Dr. Smith. Often, the external committee member will be someone with clinical expertise in the dissertation topic. Sometimes, it will be someone with methdologic expertise, but this is less common because often such expertise can be found in the department (thus, from internal members of the committee). It is also possible to identify a clinical collaborator who is not necessarily a member of your committee, but who may contribute to your dissertation science.\nBy end of year 2, you should also be making significant progress on your dissertation aims. These need not necessarily be set in stone by end of year 2, but you should have a topic, and a general idea of what your dissertation will look like.\nFinally, you will have taken and (hopefully) passed your pre-qualifying exam. This is a 2-day exam comprised of 4 sections (policy, study design, analysis, and a manuscript review). If you did not pass, you will need to remediate the section(s) not passed. Successful remediation is required to progress further in the program. Obviously, discuss this with Dr. Smith, so we can make sure you are successful in remediation.\n\n\nYear 3\nYour coursework should be largely completed, and your dissertation topic should be solidified. Your written qualifying exam should be at least scheduled by Fall of year 3 (presuming you passed the preliminary exam), and completed by fall or spring semester. Ideally, you should submit an extramural grant in late fall/spring semester based on your dissertation work.\n\n\nYear 4\nYou should schedule and pass your oral qualifying exam. This year is spent on your dissertation.\n\n\nYear 5, as needed\nYou should complete your dissertation and defend. Funding for this year is not guaranteed and dependent on progress towards your defense. Funding beyond this year is highly unlikely.\n\n\n\n10.1.2.2 What does your committee look like?\nYour PhD thesis committee serves as your guidance team during your research, and should be viewed as colleagues and collaborators. There is a required minimum for interaction with the committee, but you try to go above and beyond this. After you have formed the committee, it is advisable to hold a committee meeting at least once a year, but it is encouraged to continually interact with committee members as needs arise with developing/executing the project.\nWhile building your thesis ideas, discuss with Dr. Smith. For PhD committees, four members is the usual size, though some students will have a fifth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Dr. Smith), two additional COP graduate faculty members (note that these will generally be POP faculty, but could be other COP graduate faculty and sometimes even members from other colleges who hold POP graduate faculty status), and ~1 external member (most often someone with clinical expertise in the dissertation topic). Aim to hold your first committee meeting no later than during the Winter of your 2nd year.\n\n\n10.1.2.3 What is expected of committee meetings?\nThis depends largely on where you’re at in the program. During the first meeting, you should bring everyone up to speed on your background, your progress through the program, and your thoughts for your dissertation topic and specific aims. It’s likely you’ll receive feedback that alters these aims to some degree – but that’s normal and okay. As committee meetings progress, we expect that your presentations will similarly progress. Nitty gritty details/problems/barriers are best reserved for individual meetings with committee members or with the lab group. These full committee meetings should really be focused on ‘big-picture’ accomplishments and issues as you progress through your PhD program. Some of these members you may not have a lot of access to – what do you really want them to give you feedback on during these meetings?\n\n\n10.1.2.4 What does your proposal look like?\nA proposal describing the research that will comprise the dissertation is a required, formal part of the academic program. Proposals should describe the goals and themes of the research to be conducted, and its context within current state of knowledge. The proposal should outline the research questions that each chapter (or paper) will address, and give a description of the methods that will be used in each. The proposal serves as a guiding document for the remainder of your program and is the document that you and your committee will use to agree on the scope of work to be completed to fulfill the degree requirements. Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used for each of these, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the proposal to be up to 12 pages of text. Detail of planning for each chapter will not be as comprehensive (it is expected that later chapters may not be as fleshed out), but the proposal should provide enough detail of what the student will do for the committee to evaluate whether the scope of work is sufficient (and likely make recommendations for reducing or refining this). It is common for students to have completed or be close to having completed work for at least one of the chapters by the time of defending the proposal.\nUltimately, the proposal serves to clarify and outline expectations for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the thesis itself (indeed you will re-use some of the text later).\n\n\n10.1.2.5 What does your dissertation ultimately look like?\nYou have two options: a conventional dissertation, or three papers. Most students in our program choose the three papers, but the choice is yours. If you choose 3 papers, that means that we expect you to actually submit and publish (at least) 3 papers from your dissertation work. And, the Graduate School will still require you put together a formal dissertation report. Good news is you’ll have access to plenty of examples of this from students and former grads in our program.",

All post-docs, as well as graduate students (2nd year, onward) are expected to present at this meeting ; 1st year grad students are also very welcome, if they have work to present. You are encouraged to apply for both the poster and oral presentation slots, but at a minimum, will be invited to present a poster. Typically, this meeting is held in HPNP (posters in the Atrium and throughout the first floor, and presentations in the main lecture hall).\nAbstracts can be submitted to the Research Showcase, whether or not you have already submitted, or plan to submit, the abstract to a larger meeting. Submitting at the Research Showcase will not preempt you from presenting the research elsewhere. In fact, it is a very good idea to submit the same abstract to the COP Research Showcase and a national meeting (two birds, one stone and all).\n\n\n12.1.1.2 The COM Celebration of Research\nLikewise, the COM holds their research showcase, called “Celebration of Research” in February typically, with posters/presentations done on the floor of the O’Connell Center. This is quite similar to the COP showcase, and the same information above applies. Typically, most, if not all abstracts, are accepted, and presenting here will not preempt your ability to present elsewhere, including COP Research Showcase and national meetings.\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Cardiology/Cardiometabolic Conferences\n\n12.1.2.1 American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions\nThe AHA Scientific Sessions is a huge meeting, and the premier cardiology-focused meeting in the world. Typically the meeting is in November. It is a clinically-focused meeting, so abstracts should have clear clinical implications; methods-heavy work is usually not ideal.\n\n\n12.1.2.2 AHA Council Meetings (Hypertension & Epi-Lifestyle)\nThe AHA is broken up into “Councils” (various focus areas within the broader CV community). There are two council meetings we frequently present at: Hypertension Scientific Sessions and the Epi/Lifestyle Scientific Sessions. Hypertension is a bigger meeting, but epi/pharmacoepi is only a component of it; much of the work presented there is basic or clinical. Still, it’s a good place for hypertension-related work with a clinical focus. Epi/lifestyle is smaller and does take some more methods-focused work, provided it’s specifically relevant to CV research.\n\n\n12.1.2.3 American College of Cardiology\nThe ACC Annual Meeting is Another large meeting, though not as big as AHA. Often (but not always) held in D.C. This is another clinically-focused meeting, broadly focused on cardiovascular disease. Methods work is less likely to get traction here.\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Pharmacoepi/Pharmaceutical Outcomes Conferences\n\n12.1.3.1 ICPE\nICPE is the annual meeting of the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology, held every other year in North America and elsewhere on the off-years (often Europe, but not always). Always in August. This is a very p-epi focused meeting, but both clinical and methods work is acceptable. Students are often able to get travel grants for this meeting. You should try to present work here at least once during your training program, and it is an excellent place to network within our field.\n\n\n12.1.3.2 ISPE Mid-year\nICPEs little sibling, primarily held for students in the spring. Another good opportunity to present your clinically- or methods-focused work. It is smaller than ICPE, but the programming is tailored towards students/trainees.\n\n\n12.1.3.3 ISPOR\nISPOR is a relatively bigger meeting than ICPE, and heavily attended by industry. If you’re interested in an industry career, you should attend ISPOR at least once. Will accept both clinically-focused and methods-focused work, and very friendly to student submissions.\n\n\n\n12.1.4 ACCP\nRegrettably, pharmacy organizations do not have any particularly research-focused meetings. The American College of Clinical Pharmacy Annual Meeting is probably the best of the group, but the quality of the research here is variable and sometimes not as high as many of the above conferences. That said, if you want to get some networking experience in pharmacy circles, this is a good meeting. Note that the programming is very heavy on “clinical” – good for generating research ideas (i.e., understanding where important gaps still exist), but you will not get exposure to much research methodology.\n\n\n12.1.5 AMIA Annual Symposium\nAMIA has a large number of meetings each year (you can see the list here). This is a very informatics-focused group, but potentially some of our work may fit here, particularly methods-related work.\n\n\n12.1.6 Other Meetings\nThere are a million other meetings that might be of interest to you and/or relevant to a particular project. Others worth considering:\n\nSociety for Epidemiologic Research\nAmerican Geriatrics Society\nKidney Week (American Society of Nephrology)\nAcademyHealth (somewhat more HSR and health policy-focused)\n\nThe above is by no means a comprehensive list. If you learn of others that may be interest to the group, please add them by clicking the Edit this page github link at the bottom of the right menu.",

    "text": "12.3 Where to Print a Poster\nUF Printing Services maintain a list of printing services/locations on UF campus. For posters, you will need a plotter, which is only available at some of the locations on the above website.\nAdditional options can be found at the Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Institute, as well as other businesses in Gainesville (e.g., Target Copy), but UF options are likely to be least expensive.\nYour best bet is to ask your fellow trainees where they’re getting their posters printed. New options pop up all the time, and they can probably give you the best sense of what has worked for them – and what hasn’t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster sizing\n\n\n\nBe careful with L x W dimensions of your poster file vs. the eventual printed poster. The portrait poster templates above are 36” (W) x ~50” (L) and the landscape poster templates are ~55” (W) x ~35” (L). Most of the plotter printers print a maximum of 36” in one of the dimensions (W or L, depending on orientation of the poster) and essentially unlimited in the other dimension. So, both of these will be printed at about 100% scale. The other (older) templates are at 18” x 36”, so would be printed at 200% scale. The point is, you need to understand at what scale you’re printing – or better yet, get someone at the printing office to help scale it correctly.\nFinally, your best bet is usually to save your PPTX file to a PDF (vector-based image) that will print without losing quality at any adjusted scale. And, where possible, use vector-based figures (SVG, EPS, or PDF) – these, too, will scale without losing quality, whereas raster-based figures (PNG, JPG, TIF, etc..) will not. If you go with the latter, make sure you save them as big enough images that you don’t need to scale them up substantially to be able to print a large poster.",

Discuss with the POP Administrative Assistant (Gabby or other) how best to pay for or get reimbursed for this. For the COP research showcase, the POP department covers the cost. You’ll need to seek approval from Dr. Segal.\nYou should seek out sources of support for travel and other costs associated with attending conferences. The CICMD helps offset travel if you have an accepted poster/presentation (you will need to acknowledge the support of CICMD). Many conferences also offer travel support for trainees.\nSpeak to your colleagues in the department for other possible sources of support",

    "text": "If you haven’t already, check out the CVmedLab lab doc called Scientific Writing\nEach major section of a manuscript should begin on a new page: title page, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references, tables (each on a new page), and figures (each on a new page).\nEverything should be Arial font, size 11; every page (except title page) should be double-spaced; title page should be single-spaced\nMajor headings (Introduction, Methods, etc..) should be bold. Second-level headings should be italic. Third-level headings should be underlined.\nPages should be numbered (preferably top right corner).\nFigures trump tables in terms of presenting all but the simplest data. Figures are much more likely to be re-used by others in presentations, review articles, news articles, etc…\nTables come before figures sequentially in the manuscript.\nFigures should be vector images (.SVG preferably; alternatively, .EPS); these do not lose quality when scaled up (zoomed in on). Both SAS and R can output SVG files fairly easily. If you’re designing figures (as opposed to outputting data-based plots), consider Adobe Illustrator (smallish annual fee) or draw.io which is good for creating diagrams (design schematics, flow charts, etc..) and can output SVG files.\nRegardless of what the journal says, embed figure(s) directly in the manuscript file; if the journal requests that figures be submitted separately, do that also (in addition to embedding them), but keep them embedded either way. This makes it easier for reviewers to see figures at the size you want them to, rather than what the journal’s submission software includes them in the PDF as.\nMost journals allow for unlimited tables/figures in the Supplement. You should consider using a supplement liberally, meaning putting tables/supplements in the figure if you think they’ll be of interest to only a limited section of the readership of a journal. Most often, we will include study design figures and patient flow diagrams in these, as well as, e.g., sensitivity analysis results. They also can be used for additional methodologic details if you find the main text Methods section becoming too bloated. Basically, anything potentially of interest to at least some readers (or that can be helpful in mitigating likely reviewer critiques) should go in the Supplement.\nEverything in the Supplement can be single-space; if the Supplement is particularly long, consider adding a Table of Contents page (page after the title page)",

We list some manuscripts the lab tends to publish in (as well as others in the field), but your particular manuscript may not be ideal for any of these; indeed, the manuscript and the journal need to be a good match, both in terms of content and impact. If you have a good clinical message, consider a clinical journal; if it’s more technically/methodologically-oriented, target either an epi-type journal or a methods-type journal. If you have what we expect to be a high impact paper, we should aim for a high impact journal. If it’s more moderate impact, we shouldn’t waste time with high impact journals - let’s find the right match the first time.\nThis is a skill – matching your manuscript with a good journal fit – you should work on developing during your PhD, as it will come in handy in the future in almost any job.\nDon’t get too hung up on the impact descriptions here, as they are pretty subjective.\n\n*indicates open access (OA)-only journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus\nHigh Impact\nModerate Impact\nLower Impact (still solid)\n\n\n\n\nHypertension\n\nHypertension\n\n\nAmerican Journal of Hypertension\nJournal of Hypertension\n\n\nJournal of Human Hypertension\nJournal of Clinical Hypertension*\n\n\n\nCardiology-General\n\nCirculation\nJournal of American College of Cardiology (JACC)\nJAMA: Cardiology\nEuropean Heart Journal\n\n\nCirculation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes\nJournal of American Heart Association\nInternational Journal of Cardiology\nAmerican Heart Journal\nAmerican Journal of Cardiology\n\n\nAmerican Heart Journal Plus: Cardiology Research and Practice*\nHeart\nEuropean Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy\nEuropean Journal of Preventive Cardiology\nCardiovascular Therapeutics\n\n\n\nEpi/Pharmacoepi\n\nAmerican Journal of Public Health\nEuropean Journal of Epidemiology\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\nJournal of Clinical Epidemiology\nInternational Journal of Epidemiology\nClinical Epidemiology\nAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine\n\n\nDrug Safety\nValue in Health\nJournal of Public Health\nEpidemiology\nPreventing Chronic Disease\nBMC Public Health\n\n\nPharmacoepidemiology & Drug Safety (arguably higher impact for p-epi studies)\nMedical Care\n\n\n\nInformatics\n\nJournal of the American Medical Informatics Association\nLancet Digital Health\nJournal of Biomedical Informatics\n\n\nBioinformatics\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making\nJournal of Medical Internet Research\n\n\n\n\nPharmacotherapy-General\n\nEuropean Heart Journal-Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy\nClinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics\nPharmacotherapy\n\n\nCardiovascular Drugs and Therapy\nAnnals of Pharmacotherapy\nClinical Therapeutics\n\n\nJournal of American Pharmacists Association\nJournal of American Health -Systems Pharmacists\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to discuss with Dr. Smith whether funds are available to support publishing, including open access.

Quite a bit of our work is done on OneFlorida+ data, or data from OneFlorida+ and other PCORnet CRNs. The good news is they all adhere to the PCORnet common data model (scroll to the bottom of the page), which you will need to familiarize yourself with if you’re working on OneFl+/PCORnet data. In particular, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the relevant tables and variables. If you’re unsure whether you’ll be working with OneFl+/PCORnet data, ask Dr. Smith.\nOneFlorida+ includes EHR data from health system partners across Florida (UF, University of Miami, University of South Florida, Orlando Health, Florida Hospital [Orlando], Tallahassee Memorial, and others), as well as University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) and Emory University. In addition, it contains Florida Medicaid claims data. Data are generally available from ~2012 onward. As you’ll see on reviewing the common data model, the available data are generally structured data (rather than unstructured clinical texts like provider notes, imaging reports, etc..).\n\n\n15.1.2 UFHealth data\nThe UF integrated data repository is a database of UFHealth EHR data, including both structured and unstructured data. The IDR has an i2b2 implementation which can be used for simple queries, i.e., to find counts of patients that meet certain criteria. The IDR i2b2 implementation can be found here (you’ll need to register for an account here and you’ll need to be on campus or on the HSC VPN to access i2b2).\nWe are currently in the process of linking UFHealth data with our Medicare claims data for patients in both data sources.",

CoDES has in-house MAX data for over &gt;120 million beneficiaries residing in the 29 most populous states from 1999-2010 (AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MN, MO, MS, NC, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, WI, WV) and national data (all 50 states plus the district of Columbia) from 2011-2016.\nMedicaid data has been linked to birth certificates from the Florida Department of Health (1999-2014), Texas Department of State Health Services (1999-2012) and New Jersey Department of Health (1999-2010). The entire national Medicaid data set includes validated mother-infant linkages.\n\n\nMedicare\nMedicare data include claims for inpatient, skilled care nursing facility, and hospice care (Part A) as well as outpatient care (Part B) and prescription drugs (Part D). CoDES center has a somewhat complicated sample of Medicare, due in part to our desire to link UFHealth EHR data with Medicare data.\nBasically, the current sample includes the following:\n\nA 5% national Medicare sample (random sample of 5% of Medicare patients nationwide who meet the above criteria for parts A, B, and D) for the years 2011 through 2015 plus 1 million beneficiaries in FL sampled from individuals who reside in the UF Health catchment area (to ensure we could link most UFHealth patients)\nA 15% national Medicare beneficiaries plus the entire state of Florida for 2016-2018, totaling &gt;8 million lives.\n\nWe are anticipating continuing to grow the data (additional years).\nResDAC contains excellent documentation of the Medicare files, variables, and availability from year-to-year. If you’re going to use Medicare data, you’ll need to get to know these data dictionaries.\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Marketscan\nThe IBM Marketscan Commericial claims database includes 2005-2020 health insurance claims for inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy encounters, as well as enrollment data from large employers and health plans across the United States who provide healthcare coverage for their employees, their spouses, and dependents. The current dataset includes &gt;192 million lives.\nThe Medicare Supplemental data includes 2005-2020 enrollment records along with inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims for &gt;12.9 million retirees in the United States with Medicare supplemental coverage through privately-insured fee-for-service, point-of-service, or capitated health plans.\nThe Health Risk Assessment (HRA) data includes 2012-2018 self-reported biometric and health-related behavioral data obtained through surveys of employees of large US corporations and health plans. HRA is linked to medical, pharmacy, and enrollment data for these employees in the Commercial claims data (above) and used to examine the relationships between health behaviors/risk and health outcomes or medical expenditures. Linked data is available for about 5% of beneficiaries.",

Includes adjudicated cardivoascular events, as well as all-cause death data through at least 2015.\nWISE cohort - we have access to the Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) cohort, which was a multisite prospective cohort study of women with suspected myocardial ischemia.\nWomen Take Heart - we have access to the Women Take Heart cohort, which was a Chicago-based prospective cohort study of ~8k women without cardiovascular disease, enrolled in 1992 and with death follow-up through at least 2008.\nWARRIOR trial - The Women’s IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events In Non-ObstRuctive CAD is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE design) of a pragmatic strategy of intensive medical therapy (incl. ACEI or ARB + statin) vs usual care in 4,422 symptomatic women with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)\n\n\n\n15.3.2 Publicly-Available datasets\nThe CDC curates a number of valuable datasets that are relatively easy to access and generally offer cleaned, curated datasets that are analysis-ready.

    "text": "16.2 R\n\n16.2.1 Base R\nYou can download base R for free from C-RAN here. Make sure you select the correct file for your computer system (and chip, if using a Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need base R\n\n\n\nYou need to install base R, even if you will use R-Studio (recommended). Otherwise, R-Studio won’t do you much good.\n\n\nInstallation should be straight-forward and easy, and you can use defaults. If needed, there are comprehensive instructions (HTML and PDF) available on C-RAN.\nThe R development team has some good, if somewhat dense, manuals available at C-RAN here. A good place to start is the Intro to R (HTML and PDF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBase R is updated pretty frequently, but you won’t be bugged about it. It’s a good idea to check periodically to see if you are behind a few releases. The easiest way to update is to just re-install the new version, using the same process you did the first time around (download the compiled software and re-install; it will write over the old version).\nUnlike python, the R development team takes great pains to not break things with any new releases, so it’s rare that an update will cause you any problems with old code.\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2 R-Studio and extensions\nWe recommend you use R-studio on top of R. Select the free desktop version here (note: skip to step 2 since you will have hopefully already installed base R). Again, make sure you download the correct file for your operating system and note that the website often assumes you run Windows - if you don’t, scroll down a bit further to make sure you get the right file for your OS.\nAgain, installation should be straight-forward and easy, and you can use defaults.\nThere are some useful extensions for R-studio, but none are absolutely necessary:\n\nQuarto - useful for generating all sorts of R-markdown, including papers (yes, you could actually write your manuscript in Quarto), technical reports, websites, books (this lab manual was written with Quarto!); the beauty of R-markdown is you can weave together plain text and R code seamlessly into an output document (.html, .docx, .pdf, etc) - that means you can have all of your analysis code re-generate everything automatically any time you make a slight change to the cohort or underlying data.\n\nOne ‘to-do’ for the lab might be to make a manuscript template which would make writing routine parts of manuscripts considerably easier 🤔\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 R packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Packages\n\n\n\nR packages are installed by typing install.packages(\"package_name\") in the interactive window (or in a new script, which is then run). For example, install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also install multiple packages at once: install.packages(c(\"dplyr\",\"haven\",\"ggplot2\",\"stringr\")).\nYou’ll sometimes see ‘dependencies’ installed as well - these are other packages that are required to run the package(s) you’re installing. If you get questions about compiling from source, just select No unless you really need that slightly newer version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction vs. Development packages\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below listed packages are all hosted on C-RAN and can be installed with the install.packages() function. You may come across packages in development that you want to install, or development versions of established packages that have not been pushed to C-RAN yet. These can usually be installed from, e.g., github, using the devtools package, with something like devtools::install_github(\"github_user/package_name\") and typically the package will supply a similar instruction if you find the associated webpage or github page.\n\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nThe following packages are particularly useful for dealing with raw data as well as basic analyses:\n\ntidyverse - a suite of packages that make R considerably easier to learn for the new user (in our opinion); bonus points because they’re supported by Posit (makers of R-Studio) and are constantly being improved, unlike some packages which eventually languish. We suggest installing the entire tidyverse with install.packages(\"tidyverse\") but you can also install components of the tidyverse individually\n\nhaven - useful functions to read in SAS files\nggplot2 - excellent graphics program - see below.\ndplyr - data manipulation\npurrr - enhanced functional programming\nstringr - tools for working with strings\nreprex - tools for creating reproducible examples\nforcats - working with factors\nand more…\n\ndata.table - an alternative to working with “tibbles” (dataframes in tidyverse), data.table offers a high-performance (fast) version of base R’s data.frame with syntax and feature enhancements; some people prefer data.table to tidyverse/tibbles, and once you learn the syntax (which can be a little awkward), it is a pretty useful package, particularly when working with larger datasets like we use\nlabelled - If you’ve gotten enough experience with R and SAS (or SPSS), you might notice one of the distinct differences: SAS/SPSS allow for labeling variables, R does not. This package provides that functionality to R. You know what your variables are, but for the rest of us who don’t, labeling helps a lot\njanitor - has some useful data cleaning functions; nothing super complicated, but it will save you some time, particularly when bringing in messier data\nMore to come…\n\n\n\nGraphics & Tables\n\nggplot2 - comes with tidyverse, so does not need separate installation, but will be your go-to for plotting much of what you’ll want.\n\nggplot2 also has lots of very useful extension, which can be found here. Some we particularly like include patchwork, ggrepel, ggthemes, ggsci, ggdist, ggsignif, and survminer (there are &gt;100!)\n\nplotly - interactive graphics\ngt - great tables(?) - a tidyverse-syntaxed tables package that has some very nice extensions, see below; note that there are lots of other output table-oriented packages (the gt page lists many of these other packages) - and you may find some of these more to your liking.\ngtExtras - extension for {gt} that adds some nifty functionality, including small plots in table rows\ngtsummary - extension for {gt} for creating summary tables. See Lab Docs on the CVmedLab website for an example using gtsummary.\n\n\n\nInteractive data presentation\n\nshiny - build interactive web apps and dashboards from R\n\n\n\nPackage development\nPackages come in all shapes and sizes and don’t have to be a set of fancy functions to be used by the R community. A common use of R packages is collating everything needed for an analysis/paper (data, notes, analytic code, +/- the paper itself). If you’re going to create packages, the following are extremely helpful:\n\ndevtools - simplifies common tasks in package development (also helpful in downloading non-C-RAN packages/versions, e.g., from github)\nusethis - automates repetitive tasks in package development\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nTons of packages in this space, but if you want to stick with the tidyverse, tidymodels is a good choice.\nFor regression modeling, Frank Harrell’s rms package is good and well supported with a website.\n\n\nColor palettes\n\nmonochromeR\nmunsell\npaletteer - most of the R color palettes floating around in space assembled in one package\n\n\n\nOther Odds-and-Ends Packages\n\ndaggity - for creating DAGs and much more (if you’re using ggplot2, you may want to also check out ggdag)\nHmisc - Frank Harrell’s Hmisc package with lots of functionality; also works well with his R Workflow (see links below)\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Useful R resources\n\nr4ds - R for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham, is an excellent, free introduction to R and the tidyverse\nAdvanced R - A step up in complexity from r4ds (and best tackled after r4ds), but another excellent book by Hadley Wickham\nggplot2 Book - Excellent book, again by Wickham, that overviews ggplot2 capabilities.\nBiostatistics for Biomedical Research - online course covering lots of statistical (and more broadly, biomedical research) topics from the excellent statistician, Frank Harrell; this is more generally biostatistics-focused, but works through accompanying R code\nHarrell’s Regression Modeling Stragies Course (RMSC) - Frank Harrell’s online book/“course” that accompanies the excellent RSM textbook (Harrell 2015)\nHarrell’s R Workflow\nR pkgs - Very good book on developing R packages\nBig Book of R - A frequently-updated collection of (probably) every single online R text there is; probably most of this stuff will not be useful to you, but if you’re looking for something - there’s a good chance you can find it here.",

We share our CVs within the group in the CVmedLab Dropbox Folder (ask Dr. Smith if you don’t have access), both to give each other ideas about what to include, but also having these in one place makes it easier for Dr. Smith and others to reference information from them when needed.\nThere’s no universal approach to CVs, and your CV will change over time, as you gain experience, and as the emphasis of your career changes. The UF Career Center has some guidance for constructing your CV, but don’t feel like it’s absolutely necessary to follow their templates. The important thing is that it’s well-organized, clean (not cluttered), and makes use of white space. Finally, be careful about how much personal information you put on there, as your CV will be shared beyond those who you specifically send it to. You can always supplement personal information in an email or job application, but you probably don’t want your home address or cell phone # out there for everyone to see. If you feel like you need a number, sign up for a Google Voice number that will mask your real cell number."

Everyone in the lab can post to the lab Twitter account too. Ask Dr. Smith if you are interested in doing a takeover of CVmedLab account for a week (which could also be a chance to dip your toe in to Twitter if you don’t use it).\nIn addition to twitter, some users prefer Mastodon, which has some similarities to Twitter, but also some significant differences. The biggest difference is that there’s a lot of different iterations of Mastodon, depending on your interest.

In some cases, courtesy appointments may be made for alumni to continue a formal relationship with UF that allows for maintenance of access to your gatorlink account for a defined period of time.",

    "text": "7.2 Working hours\nAs in most of academia, the lab generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office on a certain schedule. We are all very capable of setting a working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab and as every day life happens. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with Dr. Smith to outline these.\nThough Dr. Smith often sends emails on evenings or on weekends (or whenever he can get around to his inbox), he does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during clear off hours.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends, amounting to ~20 hrs of work per week. Typically, RAs are being paid from a research grant and in most cases, training to do that research is considered part of the job, so things like courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software, etc. are part of those work hours.\nWe do not expect team members to work excessively beyond the expected 20 hours per week on the RA work. That said, there are times in which a particular deliverable requires some additional work, and other times, where work might be lighter. Put another way, deadlines might require working &gt;20 hours in a given week; however, this should generally be the exception, not the rule, and you should average something fairly close to 20 hours/week in hours worked over the semester. If you are consistently working more hours than this, talk with Dr. Smith about your workload and expectations. As noted above, we do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because figuring out how to get work done on a schedule that works for you is an important part of the learning process during your graduate work.\nAlthough there are limited expectations on exactly when you need to be in the office, we want to stress that there is value to interacting with others as part of your work and, consequently, you are expected to be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. To the extent possible, we also expect you to try to join lab meetings/functions in person. That said, we recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized.",

We do not (and you should not) expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members, including Dr. Smith, certainly may communicate during these times.",

This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc.\nBefore registering for each semester, you are required to meet with your advisor (Dr. Smith) to review your progression in the program and your planned coursework and other activities for the forthcoming semester.\nWork with Dr. Smith when crafting and revisiting your IDPs and planned coursework during your academic program. Look beyond those offered in POP to include elsewhere at COM, PHHP, CLAS and other colleges at UF. Suggested coursework, including non-required coursework options are discussed in Chapter 11.\nGrad students should schedule regular individual meetings with Dr. Smith throughout the year. Typically during the fall and spring semesters these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Dr. Smith to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Dr. Smith’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time. During the summer, lab members, including Dr. Smith, usually take some time away, so meetings may be scheduled less frequently.\nWe share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Dr. Smith strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these.\n\n7.7.1 Funding\nDr. Smith does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 3 years of full funding. Regardless of existing funding, students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter 8.",

Dr. Smith will work with each of you to further refine your IDP, which will serve as a roadmap to guide your time in the CVmedLab as it pertains to short, medium, and long-term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations and work. Graduate students will revisit their IDPs during an individual meeting with Dr. Smith at the end of each spring semester. Other lab members will revisit these at appropriate time scales (e.g. every 6-12 months).\nIn addition, it is useful to have broad (for all lab members) and specific (i.e., grad students, research staff, etc.) expectations of our roles clarified.
